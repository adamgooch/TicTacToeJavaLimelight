This is an unbeatable game of Tic Tac Toe played via a console.

To play, open your console and set your working directory to:
TicTacToe/out/production/TicTacToe/

Then run:
java PlayTicTacToe

The default play type is you against the computer.

If you want to play against a friend (or yourself, I don't judge) enter a zero after the command:

java PlayTicTacToe 0

If you want to see the computer play against itself in a blink of an eye, enter:

java PlayTicTacToe 2
