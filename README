This is an unbeatable game of Tic Tac Toe played via a console or a gui.

To play the console version, simply run: 

./play_console

You will be presented with a menu.
Enter 0 to play against a friend.
Enter 1 to play against the computer.
Enter 2 to watch the computer play against itself.

To play the GUI version, you must be running JRuby.  If you're running rvm enter:

rvm use jruby
